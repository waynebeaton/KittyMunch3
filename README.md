Android-based version of a disturbing video game from my youth.

Coming up with a great idea for a video game is harder than actually building a video game.
This is not a great idea, but it's the only one I have. I originally built this game on the
Apple II Plus in highschool. I then rewrote it on a Mac SE while in university. Now, many
years later, I've decided to use it as some motivation to learn a little about building 
stuff for Android.

This game is not meant to be particular good. Nor is it intended to offend. Something tells me
that I'm going to fail miserably on the latter. This is a game about standing on the top of a 
building dropping brinks on cats as they walk by. Why are there so many cats in this neighbourhood?
I don't know. But there are many. 

The premise of this game is intended to be a dark sort of funny. Do not harm animals. Do not
drop things off of buildings.

The game employs some simple math to fake a perspective, simple graphics and very rudimentary logic and
collision detection with the motion of the cats.

I doubt that this will ever be done; it's just something that I'm tinkering with on-and-off.

At some point, I'll need to put this into the Play Store just to get the experience of 
doing that sort of thing.

## Development and Build

This was developed using [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) with the 
[Andmore Android Development Tools](http://www.eclipse.org/andmore) plugins. It's based on
the Android 2.2 APIs. There is currently no automated build.
